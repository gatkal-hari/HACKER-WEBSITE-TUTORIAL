                <p class="text-small">Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a
                    computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security
                    systems for some illicit purpose.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A seminal figure in American hacking, Kevin Mitnick got his career start
                as a teen. In 1981, he was charged with stealing computer manuals from Pacific Bell. In 1982, he hacked
                the North American Defense Command (NORAD), an achievement that inspired the 1983 film War Games. In
                1989, he hacked Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) network and made copies of their software. Because
                DEC was a leading computer manufacturer at the time, this act put Mitnick on the map. He was later
                arrested, convicted and sent to prison. During his conditional release, he hacked Pacific Bell's
                voicemail systems.
                Throughout his hacking career, Mitnick never exploited the access and data he obtained.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">2. Julian Assange</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Perhaps the most famous hacker in the world due to his international
                presence in media, Julian Assange offers a modern-day example of how much of an impact on the world an
                individual can have through hacking. Many in the world would readily identify Assange as one of the
                biggest hackers in the world when taking into account the impact revelations his organization,
                Wikileaks, has released to the world. Through all this, Assange has been pending extraditionto the
                United States to face charges for his involvement in the Wikileaks organization.
                As of January 2021, the UK officially blocked the extradition of Julian Assnage to face charged in the
                United States.The Espionage Act was passed to deter any interference in US military operations and
                prevent individuals and groups from supporting enemies of the United States.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">3. Gary McKinnon</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Gary McKinnon must’ve been a curious, restless child, for to gain
                information on UFOs, he thought it better to get a direct access into the channels of NASA. He
                infiltrated 97 US military and NASA computers, by installing virus and deleting a few files. All the
                efforts to satisfy his curiosity, but, alas, curiosity killed the cat. It was soon found that McKinnon
                was guilty of having hacked the military and NASA websites from his girlfriend’s aunt’s house in London.
                While entering and deleting the files from these websites wasn’t enough, McKinnon thought of shaming the
                security forces by putting out a notice on the website that said, “Your security is crap.” Well, looks
                like McKinnon was something, if he could shut down the US Military’s Washington Network of about 2000
                computers for 24 hours, making the hack, the biggest military computer hack of all time!</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">4. Albert Gonzalez</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Albert Gonzalez (born 1981) is an American computer hacker and computer
                criminal who is accused of masterminding the combined credit card theft and subsequent reselling of more
                than 170 million card and ATM numbers from 2005 to 2007: the biggest such fraud in history. Gonzalez and
                his accomplices used SQL injection to deploy backdoors on several corporate systems in order to launch
                packet sniffing (specifically, ARP Spoofing) attacks which allowed him to steal computer data from
                internal corporate networks.[1] During his spree, he was said to have thrown himself a $75,000 birthday
                party and complained about having to count $340,000 by hand after his currency-counting machine broke.
                Gonzalez stayed at lavish hotels but his formal homes were modest.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">5. Kevin Poulsen</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Once one of the FBI’s most wanted hackers, Kevin Poulsen turned his life
                around to become an award winning journalist and one of the world’s top consultants on cyber crime. He
                is the author of the highly acclaimed true crime novel, Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion
                Dollar Cybercrime Underground, which served as the basis of the 2015 movie Blackhat.
                Known by federal law enforcement as “the Hannibal Lector of cyber crime” Poulsen pulled stunts such as
                taking over phone lines to win a Porsche and hacking into FBI computer databases to publicly reveal
                details of wiretaps on foreign embassies, mobsters, and the American Civil Liberties Union. After
                serving five years in federal prison, he reinvented himself as a journalist writing for WIRED as well as
                a California based web start-up called SecurityFocus. As an investigative reporter, he used his deep
                understanding of the hacking world to break nationally significant stories before the mainstream press.
                His computer assisted research led to the exposure and arrests of child sex offenders prowling MySpace
                as well as new federal legislation.</p>
